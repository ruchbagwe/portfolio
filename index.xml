      <description>Addressed pretty significant page load performance issue founde in larger deployments. Eliminates uses of intensive backend query, replacing it with an asynchronous API call against a lucene index. This change reduces page load from from 2+ minutes to nearly instant, with an incredibly responsive UI.</description>

      <title>Automated Radar Signal Analysis Based on Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://ruchbagwe.github.io/portfolio/publications/radarsignal/</link>

      <description>This paper is published in the 2020 10th Annual Computing and Communication Workshop and Conference (CCWC). In this research, a model based on the LSTM model combined with wavelet transform is proposed as a promising solution for the identification of a radar signal in a noisy environment. Radar emitter analysis is achieved by step by step process as followed:
 The first part is denoising a radar signal using a wavelet transform (WT).</description>

      <title>Added Docker Build Status Badge to shields.io</title>
      <link>https://ruchbagwe.github.io/portfolio/projects/contributions/shields-docker/</link>

      <description>Shields.io is a massive library of badges that can be inserted into project README&amp;rsquo;s or websites displaying various statuses (code coverage, health, version, etc). Support for docker was missing the current build health, and was a pretty trivial addition.</description>

      <description>While adding Structured Data to a client&amp;rsquo;s website I found some example JSON that was invalid. Simple contribution to cleanup the user documentation providing syntactically valid JSON documents.</description>

      <title>Forcing Visits to use SSL</title>

      <description>Intro Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether it&amp;rsquo;s a CakePHP app for a client, your own personal CMS, or any other web based application. If your passing around passwords or other sensitive info you should really implement SSL. SSL provides 2 main perks to your visitors.
 First it encrypts all communication that flies across the web. This prevents curious or devious billies from getting your secrets. Secondly it ensures to the user that your server is in fact who it claims, and not a nasty &amp;lsquo;man in the middle&amp;rdquo; attack.</description>

      <title>Cortically-Coupled GAN for Target Image Retrieval in RSVP</title>
      <link>https://ruchbagwe.github.io/portfolio/projects/creations/ccgan/</link>

      <description>In this project, the P300 event occurred due to the shift in attention is analyzed and captured using the electroencephalogram (EEG). Using this analysis, a model called Cortically-Coupled Generative Adversarial Network is developed. This model identifies and retrieves the target image in a rapid serial visual presentation(RSVP) event.</description>

      <title>Machine anomaly detection for Multivariate Time Series</title>
      <link>https://ruchbagwe.github.io/portfolio/projects/creations/timeseries/</link>

      <description>In this project, I have used a technique to detect anomaly in a complex system made by multiple correlated series. I have used the LSTM model to extract features from the correlated series of sensor data. The sensor data is first denoised, and then the relationship among the features is learned with dimensionality reduction. The learned relationship is them used to build an automated mechanism to alert the times of fault and failure in the machine.</description>

      <title>Product description classification using NER</title>
      <link>https://ruchbagwe.github.io/portfolio/projects/creations/1ner/</link>

      <description>n this project, the product is classified by performing entity recognition from product descriptio using NER. The laptops data was scrapped from the eBay website using Beautifulsoup. Entities are the laptop description (Product Brand, Product Model, Hard disk type/size, display type, etc.) available on the eBay site.</description>

      <description>This file exists solely to respond to /search URL with the related search layout template.
No content shown here is rendered, all content is based in the template layouts/page/search.html
Setting a very low sitemap priority will tell search engines this is not important content.
This implementation uses Fusejs, jquery and mark.js
Initial setup Search depends on additional output content type of JSON in config.toml
[outputs] home = [&amp;#34;HTML&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;JSON&amp;#34;] Searching additional fileds To search additional fields defined in front matter, you must add it in 2 places.</description>
